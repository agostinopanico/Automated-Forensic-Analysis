RULES

1. Is the 5 minute option correct when comparing the time a file was created with the time a program was used? - time bracket

	1. Look into the user time session and give this as time bracket
	2. Identify file signatures and tools that open them and try to remove those programs that do not match

2. Steps
	1. Parse the disk image, extract important files and parse those files to a .csv
	2. Run rules.py and provide the rules to use and the paths of the files

3. 


TO DO - RULES

1. Rule 1 runs for all 3 test cases

2. search user information plus time frame

Provide the investigator with what a user did in a system. Give him all user assist info and the all recent ordered.
He can then chose to investigate a file and search with the other rule.


	1. Provide a user info
		1. Give user assist, recent etc first — print that info
			1. Can you find the real timestamp of every file in the RecentDocs?????
			2. RecentDocs — OK
			3. UserAssist — OK
		2. Then go to MFT and try to find info about the info found in step 1
		3. If step 2 is not necessary, you have to take times from step 1 and try to find files in MFT

	2. Provide a time frame or leave empty and it will search everything

3. search time frame
	1. For every user in the system we must find out what happened in a specific time frame
	2. Info will be different in every user so I will do it separately for every user (SO Do Step 2 above)

4. Print info - connections for every file
	1. It will probably be a mess, though think if there is a possibility of that happening


5. Add restrictions to reduce false positives (see RULES 1. above)
